# License Plate Recognition with deep learning

This project is to find the bounding-box of the license plate in a picture (if there is any) using convolutional neural
network. The full documentation can be found under the doc folder (unfortunately only in hungarian):
- [doc/project1_Kis_Adam.pdf](doc/project1_Kis_Adam.pdf)
- [doc/round_2/onallo_project_II_Kis_Adam.pdf](doc/round_2/onallo_project_II_Kis_Adam.pdf)
- [doc/round_3/onallo_projekt_3_Kis_Adam.pdf](doc/round_3/onallo_projekt_3_Kis_Adam.pdf)

The code in this repo currently reflects the 3rd documentation under the `round_3` folder. Dataset is not included as I
don't own the rights to it.
